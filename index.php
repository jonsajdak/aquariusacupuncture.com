            "I have been receiving acupuncture from Sarah weekly for the past 10 months, and it has been a truly amazing experience. Not only is she very good at what she does, but her kind and gentle nature sets her apart from the rest. It is rare to find a doctor who listens so intently to your needs and concerns. I have always left her treatments feeling as though my issues were thoroughly addressed. Sarah's needling techniques are a perfect combination of precision and sensitivity, allowing the healing process to unfold layer by layer and in its own time."

            "After 10 years of dealing with acid reflux with little success - trying medications, seeing doctors, making lifestyle changes - I had made my mind up to get a medical procedure. Before I went through with it, I thought I'd give acupuncture a try on a recommendation from my massage therapist, who gave me Sarah's info. After 4 sessions spanning a month, my reflux symptoms were 90% better. I was amazed. Sarah has helped me where doctors could not, and I'm now living each day with only mild symptoms and often don't have any.
<br/><br/>
Side note, I'm drinking a beer as a write this. :) Two months ago, that was one item of about 100 that I had to eliminate from my diet. Now I can eat both the healthy foods and the indulgences that I thought I'd have to give up forever. I can't thank or recommend Sarah enough!"

            "Sarah has been working with me for 18 months to help with pain management and discomfort caused by nerve compression before and after spinal surgery. I found acupuncture to be more effective than heavy drugs that were recommended by my surgeon. Sarah's treatments also helped manage my anxiety related to the pain.
<br/><br/>
Sarah's treatments have greatly helped to manage dermatitis and other skin conditions. Working with her has been a turning point in a way I manage physical pain and anxiety. Sarah's care and commitment has been one of the most positive health care experiences. I have referred numerous people who have been to her with outstanding results. Not only is she a wonderful practitioner, she is an angel!!!"

             "I have had the good fortune of being treated by Sarah Sajdak for the past 9 months and have seen phenomenal changes in my physical and mental states of well-being. I was under great emotional duress when I first started my acupuncture sessions having had little success with psychotherapy, any gains made were short lived and usually reverted quickly. Every day was an emotional roller coaster where I was unable to maintain any balance, it was exhausting and extremely challenging. For the duration of my treatment Sarah was more than just my acupuncturist... she was my guide, she was my therapist, she was my friend. Sarah was there by my side every step of the way on my journey and for that I am eternally grateful. I firmly believe that emotional and psychological disorders are physiological and must be treated as such, talk therapy can be helpful but if you don't feel well you cannot think well. Sarah is the best acupuncturist I have ever seen, I am truly thankful for her help."

            "Sarah is an amazing acupuncturist. I began seeing her for pain in my shoulder that had existed for almost 15 years. I had learned to live with it and didn't expect anything but the same brief relief a massage sometimes brings. Even after my first visit, the pain didn't come back for days! And as I kept going weekly, my shoulder loosened up more and more and there was less and less pain. Now, I've moved away but still only rarely need any help controlling my shoulder pain. In addition, Sarah worked with me to help ease my desire to smoke along with a host of other small issues; She truly became my first stop for anything from anxiety to a cold. Sarah is also the kindest, warmest practitioner who will always make the time to be sure you are well taken care of, but even if she was grumpy and unaccommodating I'd still see her for her talent!"

She has a deep passion for what she does and it shows in her practice."

            "I discovered Sarah (Aquarius Acupuncture) through a dear friend a few years ago when we were in graduate school studying social work. Word of mouth quickly spread about Sarah's amazing skills, gentle presence, and the benefits of receiving acupuncture, and soon it seemed half the students in our class were booking sessions with her! As a psychotherapist, I spend many hours focusing on other people, and it has been difficult to carve out time for self care. Receiving acupuncture from Sarah is the most rejuvenating, restorative, and healing part of my week; it helps keep me in balance physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I highly recommend Sarah and Aquarius Acupuncture for treatment of acute symptoms as well as for preventative care / maintaining health and wellness."

            "I highly recommend Sarah Sajdak at Aquarius Acupuncture.  Sarah is a natural.  She makes intuitive, common sense dietary and herbal recommendations regularly.  She also sells high quality herbs at cost.
<br/><br/>
Sarah's way with needles is effortless.  I only experience occasional and very brief discomfort.  She has a lot of fun which makes treatments less like going to the doctor and more like an adventure into multidimensional palaces of healing energy.
<br/><br/>
After three treatments I felt much better and after six treatments I'm now starting to feel my body's healing energy gaining momentum.  Aquarius Acupuncture is an oasis of healing magic in a charming pocket of NYC."

            "I've been seeing Sarah for several years now, and I am always impressed by how gentle and empathetic she is as a healer. Some acupuncturists have their rote treatments and never deviate, but Sarah is kind enough to adjust to whatever I need that day or week. (This is especially important to me, because one of the major things acupuncture helps me deal with is anxiety, so sometimes certain points are harder to handle than others.) I can tell when I haven't been to see her in a while and need a tune-up — that's how great she is! Her office is clean and smells great, and I trust her implicitly. Plus, she is just a really nice person whose company I enjoy!"

            "I've been seeing Sarah for more than a year for anxiety, neck and shoulder pain, sleep problems, and IBS. Unlike my previous experiences with medications and psychotherapy, acupuncture with Sarah has dramatically reduced my stress levels, made me more focused and balanced, and greatly decreased the neck and shoulder pain I experience as a symptom of anxiety. Sarah puts every one of her clients at ease from the moment you walk in the door. Unlike every doctor I've ever encountered, Sarah explains the hows and the whys of your symptoms and her treatments and remedies, so you actually learn how things interconnect. She is an incredible listener and seeing her is truly one of the highlights of my week."

             "I came to Aquarius Acupuncture for help with a running injury that had brought me to tears. Besides being in real pain, I wasn't able to run, which made my circumstances doubly bad. Sarah listened carefully and created a treatment plan that worked beautifully.  It didn't work instantly, but it wasn't expected to. But after several sessions it really did work. I stopped hurting and was able to get back to running. I'm very grateful to Sarah."

             "I have always suffered with intestinal issues as well as from the effects of a stressed and busy New Yorker's life. Sarah not only administers acupuncture to help the healing process but also made some other recommendations which have relieved me of these lifelong stomach problems and have helped to lower my stress levels.
<br/><br/>
Because of a busy schedule I may not get to her for a few weeks. During those times I do not feel the same sense of physical and emotional balance as I do when I see her on a regular basis. It may be hard to believe but as soon as she puts the needles in my body, I am able take a restful nap.
Sarah is one of the loveliest people you will ever meet."

    "I began seeing Sarah for acupuncture to stimulate my fertility and have continued to see her throughout my pregnancy. She was recommended by a friend, and I am so grateful to have been pointed in her direction. Sarah is wonderfully compassionate and gentle as well as a great listener and confidante. I have full confidence in her practice and always leave my sessions feeling incredibly relaxed. Perhaps most important, with the assistance of Sarah's treatment, I have been able to maintain a healthy mind and body during my pregnancy. I can't thank her enough."

"I've been going to Sarah for about 6 months now, and my life is better for it.  She has vastly helped alleviate my stress, anxiety, and bouts of the blues, and has eased my knee and hip pain as well.  Her office is a beautiful oasis in a highly convenient location (very close to The Strand), and she keeps the space feeling calm and peaceful thanks to her thoughtful use of scent and sound.  She is also a warm, gentle, and uplifting person with whom I feel extremely comfortable.  I'm so grateful that Sarah's skill and great energy is now part of my wellness routine, and I can't recommend her more highly."

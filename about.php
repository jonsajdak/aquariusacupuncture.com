Dr. Sarah Emily Sajdak is an intuitive healer who uses traditional Chinese medicine to treat the underlying root causes of disease pattern and disharmony in the body. Sajdak is the founder and originator of Beauty Acupuncture. Using holistic methods Sajdak works with actors, models and celebrities for non surgical, natural, and organic beauty solutions. Sajdak's Beauty Acupuncture method is a holistic remedy that reduces lines, acne, dryness, puffiness, under eye circles, and evens out skin tone and restores skin's natural glow.

Sajdak's treatments strengthen the system so that the body can naturally return to a state of balance. This way, as ailments are relieved, signs and symptoms do not return, and the patient will be empowered to maintain his or her wellbeing and overall health. Traditional Chinese medicine is unique in its ability to bring success to any treatment plan, whether through primary or complementary healthcare. Sarah's particular interests include internal medicine, emotional disorders, women's health, pain management, migraines, and skin conditions.
